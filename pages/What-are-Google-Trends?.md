In this article, we dive into exactly what Google Trends is measuring and explore how It can be useful. 

### What does Google trends measure anyway ? 

From the FAQ of Google Trends: 

*Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and ime range it represents to compare relative popularity. Otherwise, places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.
The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics.* —[Google Trends FAQ](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365533?hl=en)

So, it allows us to display interest in a particular topic from around the globe or down to city-level geography. for each word in your search Google finds how much search volume in each region and time period your term had relative to all the searches in that region and time period. It’s anonymized (no one is personally identified), categorized (determining the topic for a search query) and aggregated (grouped together).
