It has been common knowledge for quite some time that Google, amongst other companies, have a great influence on events. People were made even more aware of this influence, recently, during the 2016 American elections. 
A group of researchers have recently developed a theory which states that Google Trends allow to predict the present. You must ask yourself, how can we predict the present ? The idea is to use Google Trends from previous weeks or months and see if those trends give us a good representation of what is happening right now. 
We decided to use the methods behind this theory to pursue a project of our own. 

First of all, we decided to study the link between initial claims for unemployment benefits and specific google trends. This example was presented in the original paper but we decided to view the data on another type of figure to give us another perspective and to push the analysis further by applying the method on another time scale.   

The  aim  of  the second part of our project was to study how Google Trends allow us to forecast near-term values of economic indicators, the US dollars/euro rate in our case. Google Trends are widely used in economic studies since the principal  advantage  is  that  Google search  data  is  easy  to  acquire  and  provides  economically significant  improvements  in  forecast  performance. The latter is of  particular  interest  to  central  banks  and  other  government agencies.
Some time period are of particularly interest to us, especially the 2007 recession period. Indeed, it is quite obvious that the economic indicators changed radically during this period, but it would be even more interesting to see if Google Trends of weeks/months preceding this period could partly explain the change in those economic indicators. 
To help us on our project, we relied on a paper (reference) which carried a similar project and it allowed us to have an overview of the Google Trends we should look at.

## 1.A. What does Google Trends measure anyway?

From the FAQ of Google Trends: 

*Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity. Otherwise, places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.
The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics.* — [Google Trends FAQs](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365533?hl=en)

So, it allows us to display interest in a particular topic from around the globe or down to city-level geography. for each word in your search Google finds how much search volume in each region and time period your term had relative to all the searches in that region and time period. It’s **anonymized** (no one is personally identified), **categorized** (determining the topic for a search query) and **aggregated** (grouped together). 

It combines all of queries into a unique measure of popularity and scales their values across the topics so that the **largest measure is set to 100**. Indeed, it does not tell you exactly how many searches occurred for your query but gives a nice approximation.

## 1.B. The rise and fall of blu-ray

Who remembers blu-rays? This technology was used for a period, but nowadays with the emergence of streaming devices such as Netflix, you will probably make fun of someone asks you to watch a blu-ray with him. With Google trends, we can see the when was the golden age of blu-rays, as that and when it began to collapse.

According to Google searches of the term 'Blu-ray Disc' in all countries, we can see that the popularity of blu-ray discs was the highest in 2009/2010, few years after its launch, but decreases continuously since these years
