It has been common knowledge for quite some time that Google, amongst other companies, have a great influence on events. People were made even more aware of this influence, recently, during the 2016 American elections. 
A group of researchers have recently developed a theory which states that Google Trends allow to predict the present. You must ask yourself, how can we predict the present ? The idea is to use Google Trends from previous weeks/months and see if those trends give us a good representation about what is happening right now. 
We decided to use the methods behind this theory to pursue a project of our own. 


The  aim  of our project is to study how Google Trends allow us to forecast near-term values of economic indicators, the US dollars/euro rate in our case. Google Trends are widely used in economic studies since the principal  advantage  is  that  Google search  data  is  easy  to  acquire  and  provides  economically significant  improvements  in  forecast  performance. The latter is of  particular  interest  to  central  banks  and  other  government agencies.
Some time period are of particularly interest to us, especially the 2007 recession period. Indeed, it is quite obvious that the economic indicators changed radically during this period, but it would be even more interesting to see if Google Trends of weeks/months preceding this period could partly explain the change in those economic indicators. 
To help us on our project, we relied on a paper (reference) which carried a similar project and it allowed us to have an overview of the Google Trends we should look at.
